Assignment 1

Downloaded the UKLungDeaths data from R and looked at it to  get a better idea of the data available

It is cmprised of three time-series objects: both sexes (ldeaths), males (mdeaths) and females (fdeaths).
It shows monthly deaths from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma in the UK, 1974–1979

I then proceeded to perform basic descriptive stats to get a better idea  of the trends of the avilable data, I plotted each time-series and then plotted male and female together to see the correlation. 

The range showed the disparity in range from male to female deaths  and the summary stats reinforced this. Male numbers are  all together higher.  Both groups are strongly correlated , which is expected given what they are measuring and the time frame. 

This last sentence is just to practice making a change and see if it works. I would delete this last sentence
